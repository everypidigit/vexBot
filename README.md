# vex_robot
A small robot we built during Robotics labs.
The whole work took about 7-8 hours. The robot is not that good: the controls are not very precise. Fixable if needed.

### The most important part of this project is, I believe, the code that allows to control Vex motors with Arduino, which are not initially usable together.
The code was taken and modified from a video from YouTube link to which will be posted a little bit later. 

### The main parts are:
- 6 Vex electric motors&4 drivers for them 
- Arduino Uno R3,
- PS2 controller, 
- Six 2.5 inches Vex wheels. 

### Although I understand that it is not a good project, I still wanted to upload it. It is one of the first experiments I had with any hardware and Iwas truly excited to do it. There was not enough time and opportunity to make it better, though, since we only could work during lab hours.
