# vex_robot
A small robot we built during Robotics labs. The main parts are: 6 Vex electric motors&4 drivers for them, Arduino Uno R3, PS2 controller, 6 2.5 inches Vex wheels. 
The whole work took about 7-8 hours. The robot is not that good: the controls are not very precise. Fixable if needed.

The most important part of this project is, I believe, the code that allows to control Vex motors with Arduino, which are not initially usable together.
The code was taken and modified from a video from YouTube link to which will be posted a little bit later. 

Although I understand that it is not a good project, I still wanted to upload it. It is one of the first experiments I had with any hardware and I
was truly excited to do it. There was not enough time and opportunity to make it better, though, since we only could work during lab hours. Still, 
I am proud of it, in a way.
